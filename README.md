# Fetch Frontend Take-Home Exercise
Here at Fetch, we love dogs, and hope you do too! Your task is to build a website to help a dog-lover like yourself search through a database of shelter dogs, with the hope of finding a lucky dog a new home!

## General Requirements
You first should have users enter their name and email on a login screen. Then, you should use this information to hit our login endpoint to authenticate with our service (see API Reference below).

Once a user is successfully authenticated, they should be brought to a search page where they can browse available dogs. This page must meet the following requirements:

- Users must be able to filter by breed
- Results should be paginated
- Results should be sorted alphabetically by breed by default. Users should be able to modify this sort to be ascending or descending.
- All fields of the Dog object (except for id) must be presented in some form
- Users should be able to select their favorite dogs from the search results. When finished searching, they should be able to generate a match based on dogs added to the favorites list. A single match will be generated by sending all favorited dog IDs to the /dogs/match endpoint. You should display this match however you see fit.

As for everything else, you have free rein, so get creative! We strongly encourage you to go beyond the minimum requirements to build something that showcases your strengths.

You may find it helpful to make use of a component library.

### Additional Requirements
- Your app should be hosted on the internet where it can be visited and interacted with
- Your source code should be stored in a git repository and hosted on the internet (i.e. GitHub)
- You should include any necessary documentation to run your site locally


## How to submit
Please provide a link to your deployed site and your public code repository via Greenhouse.

### How will this exercise be evaluated?
An engineer will review the code you submit. You will be evaluated based on:

- Code quality
- Use of best practices
- Fulfillment of minimum requirements
- Site usability/UX

### Can I provide a private repository?
If at all possible, we prefer a public repository because we do not know which engineer will be evaluating your submission. If you are still uncomfortable providing a public repository, you can work with your recruiter to provide access to the reviewing engineer.

### How long do I have to complete the exercise?
There is no time limit for the exercise. Out of respect for your time, we designed this exercise with the intent that it should take you a few hours. However, you may take as much time as you need to complete the work.

For any further questions or clarifications, please reach out to your recruiter.

## API Reference
We provide our own backend to facilitate searching/fetching dog info. The base URL is `https://frontend-take-home-service.fetch.com`.

### Data Model
Here is the Typescript interface for the Dog objects returned by our API:

```
interface Dog {
    id: string
    img: string
    name: string
    age: number
    zip_code: string
    breed: string
}
```

We also provide endpoints for fetching location data, which should be useful if you’d like to implement filtering dogs by location. Here is the Typescript interface for the Location objects returned by our API:

```
interface Location {
    zip_code: string
    latitude: number
    longitude: number
    city: string
    state: string
    county: string
}
```
```
interface Coordinates {
    lat: number;
    lon: number;
}
```

---

### Authentication
You will need to hit the login endpoint in order to access other endpoints. A successful request to the login endpoint will return an auth cookie included in the set-cookie response header. It’s an `HttpOnly` cookie, so you will not be able to access this value from any Javascript code (nor should you need to). Your browser will automatically send this cookie with all successive credentialed requests to the API. Note that you will need to pass a config option in order to send credentials (cookies) with each request. Some documentation to help you with this:

- Including credentials with fetch (set `credentials: 'include'` in request config)
- Including credentials with axios (set `withCredentials: true` in request config)
Postman will do this for you automatically.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```
